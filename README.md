# Turnip Engine

Turnip is a game engine that follows the principles of the "yet another" mentality. It's "yet another" straightforward game engine capable of doing nothing out of the ordinary. 
It's a side project that I develop in my free time to learn more about certain aspects of game engines and graphics programming.

If you want to check out how the development is going, you can access this Trello: https://trello.com/b/GyxKro6L/turnip-engine.

# Getting Started

As of the current version, Turnip doesn't support a custom buid system like CMake or Meson.  
For now, opening the [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/pt-br/downloads/) solution file will have to suffice

## Prerequisites

In order to build this project, you need `vcpkg` installed and integrated on Visual Studio.

- [vcpkg]([https://cmake.org/download/](https://vcpkg.io/en/)https://vcpkg.io/en/)

You also need to set up an enviroment variable called `VCPKG_ROOT` to its root directory.

## Downloading
Downloading this project is straightforward. You have a couple options:

1. **Clone the Repository**: To clone the project, simply follow these steps:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.
   - Execute the following command:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/DatDarkAlpaca/turnip-engine
     ```
2. **Download the Repository directly**: If you prefer not to use Git, you can download a ZIP archive of the project:
   - [Download files](https://github.com/DatDarkAlpaca/turnip-engine/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

## Building

To build the project, open the Visual Studio solution and press `Build` using the configuration of your choice.

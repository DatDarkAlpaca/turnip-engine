# Turnip Engine

Turnip is a game engine that follows the principles of the "yet another" mentality. It's "yet another" straightforward game engine capable of doing nothing out of the ordinary. 
It's a side project that I develop in my free time to learn more about certain aspects of game engines and graphics programming.

# Getting Started

As of the current version, Turnip doesn't support a custom buid system like CMake or Meson.  
For now, opening the [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/pt-br/downloads/) solution file will have to suffice

## Prerequisites

In order to build this project, you need `vcpkg` installed and integrated on Visual Studio.

- [vcpkg]([https://cmake.org/download/](https://vcpkg.io/en/)https://vcpkg.io/en/)

You also need to set up an enviroment variable called `VCPKG_ROOT` to its root directory.

## Downloading
Downloading this project is straightforward. You have a couple options:

1. **Clone the Repository**: To clone the project, simply follow these steps:
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.
